redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom
      -npm i react-router-router-dom

       import 
       { BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
         Routes                  - to set path for each component
         Route                   - more than one path 
         } from 'react-router-dom';

useParams - Hook used to accessparams from component url



REDUX
-------
Coupling       - Many connection between parent and child component
Props drilling - In coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all the 
                 other childs will not work.

To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

For this react intoducted a new technology - State managment technology (Redux)

Redux process
---------------
Create a new js file to keep the states, all the component can access the js file
- The components can access the data from the js file , bbut they cant update datas in js file.

- Action   -> A file with all the logics to update the state
- Dispatch -> Method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the components need state updation
- Reducer  -> Update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file -


Libraries to apply redux 
-------------------------
- REDUX
- REACT REDUX 
- REDUX - THUNK 
 
  npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

  CreateStore() - Method used to create store in js file
                - 2 arguments 
                    > Reducer 
                    > Middleware (Used to make synchronous redux to asychronous)

applyMiddleware() - Method in REDUX to apply middleware.         

combineReducers() - Method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file.

thunk             - Used to create middleware 

1. Create store
2. Apply the store in index.js
    -povider   - Its a tag used to pass the store(react-redux)
